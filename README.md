A multiplatform calendar app based on the concept of taskblocks, ideal for organizing projects and habits.

# Work In Progress!

This project is heavily work in progress and is subject to change over time as features are gradually completed. Currently the app supports:

- Adding and managing tasks and habits within and between taskblocks
- Weekday and frequency based habit goals for habit tracking.
- A basic ordering system based on priority and time remaining.
    - Highest urgency task block is on the left, highest urgency task is on the top
- Task block statuses for marking projects as completed, paused, or pinned.

# Objectives

As I accumulate projects, I found that my tasks no longer were independent of each other, they were all for some larger goal. However most project management software is designed for very long term projects with a strict end product. Taskblocks warps the concept of a project into any broad catagory, a task block, including concrete projects such as a game, to indefinite groups such as health. To account for this habit tracking is built directly into each task block.

Design objectives:
- A todo list that can be quickly added to. 
- Clear work-life seperation between tasks, habits, and hobbies
- A protocol for bringing up any task, choosing the most pressing or convient task.
- Time blocking, time groups should be given parameters for time blocking, allowing for the user to allocate time for specific types of tasks.
